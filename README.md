# Pointy-lang Specification
Pointy Language is a powerful domain-specific language (DSL) for creating event-based workflows. This tutorial will guide you from basic concepts to advanced workflows using Pointy Languageâ€™s intuitive arrow-based syntax.

## Introduction to Pointy Language

Pointy Language uses arrows and operators to represent event flow, making it easy to visualise and define workflows. Its primary purpose is to model sequences of operations, conditional branching, parallel execution, and result piping.
Core Features:

  - Sequential execution of events
  - Parallel processing
  - Conditional branching based on success/failure
  - Result piping between events
  - Retry mechanisms for handling failures
