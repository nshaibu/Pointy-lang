## 1. Introduction

Pointy Language is a domain-specific language (DSL) designed for creating event-based workflows and pipeline orchestration. The language uses an intuitive arrow-based syntax to represent event flow, making it easy to visualise and define complex workflows with sequential execution, parallel processing, conditional branching, and result piping.

### 1.1 Design Goals

- **Simplicity**: Intuitive arrow-based syntax for workflow visualisation
- **Expressiveness**: Support for complex workflow patterns with minimal syntax
- **Reliability**: Built-in error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Modularity**: Seamless integration with existing Python event systems
- **Observability**: Clear representation of execution flow and decision points

### 1.2 Use Cases

- Event-driven system orchestration
- Data processing pipelines
- Microservice workflow coordination
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes
- Business process automation
- Approval and review workflows

---

## 2. Language Overview

Pointy Language operates as a thin orchestration layer over Python event implementations. Events are predefined operations that are automatically resolved during pipeline execution through integration with the `event_pipeline` module.

### 2.1 Core Concepts

- **Events**: Named units of work that can be executed
- **Flows**: Connections between events defining execution order
- **Descriptors**: Numeric codes representing execution outcomes
- **Pipelines**: Complete workflow definitions
- **Results**: Data passed between events

---

## 3. Lexical Structure

### 3.1 Character Set

Pointy Language uses the UTF-8 character set.

### 3.2 Tokens

#### 3.2.1 Identifiers (Event Names)

```
identifier ::= letter (letter | digit | '_')*
letter     ::= 'A'..'Z' | 'a'..'z'
digit      ::= '0'..'9'
```

**Rules:**
- Event names must start with a letter
- Can contain letters, digits, and underscores
- Case-sensitive
- Must be descriptive of the action being performed

**Examples:**
- `ValidateInput`
- `ProcessPayment`
- `Send_Email`
- `extract_data`

#### 3.2.2 Operators

| Operator | Symbol | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Sequential | `->` | Sequential execution |
| Parallel | `\|\|` | Parallel execution |
| Pipe Result | `\|->` | Result piping |
| Retry | `*` | Retry mechanism |

#### 3.2.3 Delimiters

- `(` `)` : Conditional blocks
- `,` : Separator for multiple conditions
- `#` : Comments (line comments only)

#### 3.2.4 Literals

```
descriptor ::= '0'..'9'
retry_count ::= digit+
```

### 3.3 Comments

Single-line comments begin with `#` and continue to the end of the line:

```
ProcessOrder -> ValidatePayment  # Check payment validity
```

### 3.4 Whitespace

Whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) is generally ignored except where it separates tokens.

---

## 4. Syntax Definition

### 4.1 Basic Expressions

#### 4.1.1 Single Event

```
event_expression ::= identifier
```

Example: `SubmitForm`

#### 4.1.2 Sequential Flow

```
sequential_flow ::= expression '->' expression
```

Example: `A -> B`

#### 4.1.3 Parallel Flow

```
parallel_flow ::= expression '||' expression
```

Example: `A || B`

#### 4.1.4 Result Piping

```
pipe_flow ::= expression '|->' expression
```

Example: `A |-> B`

### 4.2 Complex Expressions

#### 4.2.1 Conditional Branching

```
conditional_flow ::= expression '(' condition_list ')'
condition_list   ::= condition (',' condition)*
condition        ::= descriptor '->' expression
condition        ::= descriptor '|->' expression
```

Example: `A -> B (0 -> C, 1 -> D)`

#### 4.2.2 Retry Specification

```
retry_expression ::= expression '*' retry_count
```

Example: `ProcessData * 3`

### 4.3 Operator Precedence

From highest to lowest precedence:

1. `*` (Retry)
2. `|->` (Pipe Result)
3. `->` (Sequential)
4. `||` (Parallel)
5. `()` (Grouping/Conditional)

---

## 5. Operators

### 5.1 Sequential Operator (`->`)

**Syntax:** `A -> B`

**Semantics:**
- Event B executes only after Event A completes successfully
- If A fails, B does not execute
- Sequential chaining creates a dependency chain

**Associativity:** Left-to-right

### 5.2 Parallel Operator (`||`)

**Syntax:** `A || B`

**Semantics:**
- Events A and B execute concurrently
- Both events start simultaneously
- No dependency between parallel events
- Results can be combined for subsequent operations

**Associativity:** Left-to-right

### 5.3 Pipe Result Operator (`|->`)

**Syntax:** `A |-> B`

**Semantics:**
- The output of event A becomes the input for event B
- Creates a data dependency
- B receives A's result as its input parameter
- Sequential execution with data flow

**Result Combination Rules:**
- Single event result: Passed directly
- Multiple parallel results: Combined into a collection
- Failed event results: Error information propagated

### 5.4 Retry Operator (`*`)

**Syntax:** `A * n`

**Semantics:**
- Event A will be retried up to n times if it fails
- Each retry uses the same input as the original attempt
- Success on any attempt stops further retries
- Final failure occurs after all retries are exhausted

**Constraints:**
- n must be a positive integer
- Maximum retry count is implementation-defined

### 5.5 Conditional Operator (`()`)

**Syntax:** `A (condition_list)`

**Semantics:**
- Provides conditional branching based on event outcomes
- Multiple conditions can be specified
- Conditions are mutually exclusive
- Unspecified conditions result in workflow termination

---

## 6. Event System

### 6.1 Event Definition

Events are external entities defined in Python through two mechanisms:

1. **Class-based Events**: Classes inheriting from `EventBase`
2. **Function-based Events**: Functions decorated with `@event`

### 6.2 Event Registration

Events are automatically discovered and registered by the pipeline runtime. No explicit registration is required in Pointy Language syntax.

### 6.3 Event Naming Convention

- Use PascalCase or snake_case consistently
- Names should be descriptive verbs or verb phrases
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood
- Examples: `ValidateInput`, `send_email`, `ProcessPayment`

### 6.4 Event Parameters

Events can receive parameters through:
- Initial pipeline input
- Results from preceding events (via pipe operator)
- Combined results from parallel events

---

## 7. Control Flow

### 7.1 Descriptors

Descriptors are numeric codes that represent event execution outcomes:

| Descriptor | Meaning | Usage |
|------------|---------|-------|
| 0 | Failure/Error | Default failure path |
| 1 | Success | Default success path |
| 3-9 | User-defined | Custom conditions |

### 7.2 Conditional Branching Rules

1. **Default Behaviour**: If no conditional branching is specified, failure terminates the workflow
2. **Explicit Conditions**: Only specified descriptor paths are available
3. **Fallthrough**: If an event returns a descriptor not specified in conditions, the workflow terminates
4. **Multiple Conditions**: Conditions are evaluated in order, first match that wins

### 7.3 Sink Patterns

Events from different conditional branches can converge to a common subsequent event:

```
A (0 -> B, 1 -> C) -> D
```

Both B and C flow to D regardless of which branch was taken.

---

## 8. Error Handling

### 8.1 Error Propagation

- Failed events (descriptor 0) stop sequential execution unless explicitly handled
- Parallel events continue executing independently
- Unhandled failures terminate the workflow

### 8.2 Error Recovery Patterns

#### 8.2.1 Retry Pattern

```
RiskyOperation * 3
```

#### 8.2.2 Fallback Pattern

```
PrimaryService (0 -> BackupService, 1 -> ContinueFlow)
```

#### 8.2.3 Error Logging Pattern

```
ProcessData (0 -> LogError -> NotifyAdmin, 1 -> SaveResults)
```

### 8.3 Error Information Piping

Error details can be piped to error-handling events:

```
ValidatePayment (0 |-> LogPaymentError -> NotifyCustomer, 1 -> ProcessOrder)
```

---

## 9. Execution Model

### 9.1 Pipeline Initialisation

1. Parse Pointy Language expression
2. Resolve event names to implementations
3. Build execution graph
4. Validate dependencies and cycles

### 9.2 Execution Phases

1. **Planning**: Determine initial events to execute
2. **Execution**: Execute events according to dependencies
3. **Monitoring**: Track event completion and results
4. **Routing**: Route to next events based on descriptors

### 9.3 Concurrency Model

- Parallel events execute in separate threads/processes
- Sequential events execute in dependency order
- Result piping synchronises between events
- No shared state between events except passed results

### 9.4 Resource Management

- Events are responsible for their own resource cleanup
- Pipeline manages the overall execution lifecycle
- Timeout and resource limits are implementation-defined

---

## 10. Integration Requirements

### 10.1 Python Integration

Pointy Language requires integration with the `event_pipeline` Python module:

```python
from event_pipeline import EventBase
from event_pipeline.decorators import event
```

### 10.2 Event Implementation Requirements

#### 10.2.1 Class-based Events

```python
class ValidateInput(EventBase):
    def process(self, input_data) -> Tuple[bool, Any]:
        # Implementation
        return True, "Event result
```

#### 10.2.2 Function-based Events

```python
@event
def process_payment(payment_data) -> Tuple[bool, Any]:
    # Implementation
    return True, "Event result"
```

### 10.3 Runtime Requirements

- Event discovery and registration system
- Execution engine with dependency resolution
- Result passing and combination mechanisms
- Error handling and retry logic

---

## 11. Grammar Specification

```bnf
pipeline         ::= expression
expression       ::= conditional_expr
conditional_expr ::= pipe_expr ('(' condition_list ')')?
condition_list   ::= condition (',' condition)*
condition        ::= descriptor ('->' | '|->') pipe_expr
pipe_expr        ::= parallel_expr ('|->' parallel_expr)*
parallel_expr    ::= sequential_expr ('||' sequential_expr)*
sequential_expr  ::= retry_expr ('->' retry_expr)*
retry_expr       ::= primary_expr ('*' retry_count)?
primary_expr     ::= identifier | '(' expression ')'
descriptor       ::= '0'..'9'
retry_count      ::= [1-9][0-9]*
identifier       ::= [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*
```

---

## 12. Semantic Rules

### 12.1 Well-formedness Rules

1. **Event Resolution**: All event names must resolve to implemented events
2. **Descriptor Validity**: Descriptors must be in the range 0-9
3. **Retry Limits**: Retry counts must be positive integers
4. **Acyclic Dependencies**: Workflow graphs must not contain cycles
5. **Reachability**: All events must be reachable from the start

### 12.2 Type System

Pointy Language is dynamically typed with respect to event parameters and results:

- Events can accept any input type
- Result types are determined at runtime
- Type compatibility is enforced by event implementations

### 12.3 Scoping Rules

- Event names have global scope within a pipeline
- No variable binding or local scopes
- All identifiers refer to predefined events

---

## 13. Examples

### 13.1 Basic Sequential Flow

```pointy
ReceiveOrder -> ValidateInventory -> ProcessPayment -> FulfillOrder
```

### 13.2 Parallel Processing with Result Combination

```pointy
FetchUserData || FetchPreferences || FetchHistory |-> GenerateRecommendations
```

### 13.3 Error Handling with Retry

```pointy
ConnectToDatabase * 3 -> ExecuteQuery (
    0 -> LogDatabaseError -> NotifyAdmin,
    1 -> ProcessResults -> CacheData
)
```

### 13.4 Complex Workflow with Multiple Branches

```pointy
SubmitApplication -> ValidateInformation * 2 (
    0 -> RequestCorrections |-> NotifyApplicant,
    1 -> PerformCreditCheck (
        0 -> AssessRisk || OfferLimitedServices |-> NotifyDecision,
        1 -> CreateAccount || PrepareWelcomePackage |-> ActivateServices
    )
) -> SendConfirmationEmail (
    0 -> LogEmailFailure -> AttemptSMS,
    1 -> ScheduleFollowUp
)
```

### 13.5 Custom Descriptor Usage

```pointy
ReviewDocument -> MakeDecision (
    0 -> RejectDocument,
    1 -> ApproveDocument,
    3 -> RequestManagerReview -> FinalDecision
)
```

## Appendix A: Reserved Words

Pointy Language has no reserved words. All identifiers are treated as event names.

## Appendix B: Operator Summary

| Operator | Precedence | Associativity | Description |
|----------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| `*` | 1 (highest) | Left | Retry mechanism |
| `\|->` | 2 | Left | Result piping |
| `->` | 3 | Left | Sequential execution |
| `\|\|` | 4 | Left | Parallel execution |
| `()` | 5 (lowest) | N/A | Grouping/Conditional |

## Appendix C: Error Codes

Implementation-specific error codes should be documented separately by the runtime system.
